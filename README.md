Waveson Password Generator
--------------------------

Waveson Password Generator is a Windows app which combines hardware-based sources of randomness with user-specified character sets to generate passwords of varying length. It builds, in part, on my earlier work with [RDRAND](https://github.com/viathefalcon/rdrand_msvc_2010/), on which this project implicitly depends.

If you're just looking for the app, built binaries can be downloaded from [here](http://waveson.com/wpg/).
